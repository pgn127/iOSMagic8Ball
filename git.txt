1.In Xcode or IntelliJ, create a new project without a git repository. In command line, create a git
repository for your project.
2.What file is required to ignore some of the files in this repository. It’s quite common for projects
with a git repository to have these, but they need to be created manually.
 What would the file look like for:
a. An Xcode Project
b. An Android Project
Implement this file for your project.
create file ".gitignore" in the project
in command line create it by "nano .gitignore"
then you can add the files you want to ignore to the list

3. Create a new branch called “Experiment”. As part of this branch, create a new class called
ExperimentalModel. What is the git command to check the status of the repository?

git status will give you the status

4.Commit the changes you’ve made with this branch. What is the command to merge these changes
with the master branch?
commit merge master
5.Name the git command that:
a. Removes ExperimentalModel without removing it from the local file system
git rm --keep-local *insert filename here*
b. Removes ExperimentalModel and remove it from the local file system
git rm *insert filename here*
